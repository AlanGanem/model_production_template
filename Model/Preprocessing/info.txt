This folder should contain the data preprocessing scripts (or functions).

It's highly recommended to name the preprocessors after it's architecture name and it's version (i.e. the date it's been trained),
in order to keep track of the model preprocessor versions.

Also, the files should be renamed every time it's fitted (.fit()) with new data.
